    "# **1. What Is Prompt Engineering?**\n",
    "- Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear, structured inputs that guide AI systems to produce accurate, useful, and predictable outputs.  \n",
    "In short: **better instructions → better results.**  \n",
    "It combines communication skills, critical thinking, and an understanding of how AI models interpret language.\n",

    "# **2. Why It Matters**\n",
    "- AI systems respond differently depending on phrasing and context.  \n",
    "- Strong prompting improves efficiency, creativity, and correctness.  \n",
    "- Good prompts help you control tone, format, and depth of the output.  \n",
    "- It’s a foundational skill for anyone collaborating with AI—no coding required.\n",

    "# **3. Core Skills for Effective Prompting**\n",
    "- **Clarity:** Use precise language and define what you want.  \n",
    "- **Context Awareness:** Provide relevant background or constraints.  \n",
    "- **Iteration:** Refine prompts based on results rather than expecting perfection on the first try.  \n",
    "- **Decomposition:** Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.  \n",
    "- **Role Framing:** Assign the AI a role (e.g., “act as a tutor,” “act as a researcher”) to shape the response.  \n",
    "- **Output Structuring:** Specify formats (lists, tables, sections) for faster, cleaner results.\n",

    "# **4. Best Practices**\n",
    "- **Be specific, not vague:** Replace “Write about climate change” with “Give a 3-point summary of climate change impacts on coastal cities.”  \n",
    "- **Set constraints:** Time period, tone, audience, or length.  \n",
    "- **Request reasoning or steps when appropriate:** Helps ensure accuracy and transparency.  \n",
    "- **Use examples:** Provide a sample answer for style or structure.  \n",
    "- **Iterate:** Ask the AI to revise, expand, shorten, simplify, or change tone.  \n",
    "- **Check assumptions:** Ask the model to identify missing info or ambiguities.\n",
